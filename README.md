# PoshMarkDiscountBot
This bot will auto send a 10% discount to all likers of your poshmark items for sale.  Built on java and the selenium webdriver


You will need to download Java 8, selenium, and an IDE, I used Eclipse.

Java 8 JDK can be downloaded here.

Selenium can be downloaded here.

Eclipse can be downloaded here.

You will need to update the emailAddress, password, closetSize and closetURL for it to work correctly before compile.

Thoughts for improvement.  

1. Should I leave the login as empty but just make time delay of 30 seconds to sing in?
2. Find the difference bettween an item that is for sale or has been sold?
3. Does the program get captcha? I havent seen it get caught yet.
